# How to use this BOM

For purchasing, use `Circuit Board BOM.xlsx`. Enter the '1' for the functions you want included in the board on the table to the right, then copy the parts from the Auto Exporter page into Digikey/Mouser's BOM importer tools.

For an interactive BOM, use the files from the `interactive` directory in our web browser.
